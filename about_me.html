        <p>Moving to Utah wasn’t all that bad after all. After a couple of<br> months of being homesick I quickly became an enthusiastic<br> of snow boarding during  the cold winter days and during<br> summer we would take our motorcycles out for a spin and<br> enjoy the summer heat. What better way to warm up to a<br> State that isn’t home. I now love Utah and I visit my home<br> state once a year. I  married my high school sweetheart<br> Lorena 11 years ago and now we have three beautiful<br> daughters our oldest Isabella (11), our middle child Emma<br> Sofia (7) and our youngest Victoria (5).
